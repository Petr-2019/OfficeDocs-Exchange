# Configure activation policy for a mailbox database copy

 *Activation* is the process of changing a mailbox database copy from a passive copy to an active copy. Activation can occur automatically (by the system as part of a database or server failover operation) or it can be performed manually (by an administrator as part of a database or server switchover operation). Blocking a database for activation prevents it from becoming the active copy during a database or server failover.

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- Estimated time to complete this task: 1 minute

## Use the EAC to configure the activation policy for a mailbox database copy
<a name="UseEMC"> </a>

1. In the EAC, go to **Servers** \> **Databases**.

2. Select the database that you want to configure.

3. In the Details pane, under **Database Copies**, locate the database copy you want to configure and click **Suspend**.

4. Optionally, add a comment, and select the check box that says **This copy can only be activated by manual intervention**.

5. Click **Save** to save the configuration changes for the mailbox database copy.

## Use the Exchange Management Shell to suspend or resume a database copy for activation
<a name="UseEMC"> </a>

This example blocks the copy of the database DB1 on the server MBX2 for activation.

```
Suspend-MailboxDatabaseCopy -Identity DB1\MBX2 -ActivationOnly
```

This example resumes the copy of the database DB1 on the server MBX2 for activation.

```
Resume-MailboxDatabaseCopy -Identity DB1\MBX2
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Suspend-MailboxDatabaseCopy](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/database-availability-groups/suspend-mailboxdatabasecopy) or [Resume-MailboxDatabaseCopy](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/database-availability-groups/resume-mailboxdatabasecopy).

## Use the Exchange Management Shell to configure the activation policy for a server
<a name="UseEMC"> </a>

This example configures the database copies on server MBX2 as blocked for activation.

```
Set-MailboxServer -Identity MBX2 -DatabaseCopyAutoActivationPolicy Blocked
```

This example configures the database copies on server MBX3 as blocked for out-of-site activation.

```
Set-MailboxServer -Identity MBX3 -DatabaseCopyAutoActivationPolicy IntrasiteOnly
```

This example configures the database copies on server MBX4 as unblocked for activation.

```
Set-MailboxServer -Identity MBX4 -DatabaseCopyAutoActivationPolicy Unrestricted
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Suspend-MailboxDatabaseCopy](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/database-availability-groups/suspend-mailboxdatabasecopy), [Resume-MailboxDatabaseCopy](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/database-availability-groups/resume-mailboxdatabasecopy), or [Set-MailboxServer](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/mailbox-databases-and-servers/set-mailboxserver).

## How do you know this worked?
<a name="UseEMC"> </a>

To verify that you've successfully configured the activation policy, do one of the following:

- In the Exchange Management Shell, run the following command to verify activation settings for a database copy.

  ```
  Get-MailboxDatabaseCopyStatus <DatabaseCopyName> | Format-List ActivationSuspended
  ```

- In the Exchange Management Shell, run the following command to verify activation settings for a DAG member.

  ```
  Get-MailboxServer <ServerName> | Format-List DatabaseCopyAutoActivationPolicy
  ```
